Like many bigger media companies, they applied a plethora of different tools and workflows across their titles. Their main CMS was Atex Polopoly. Due to the changing landscape of content consumption, they were faced with new challenges that couldn’t be solved in the old system.",

The economic and geographical conditions of Canton Glarus allowed us to build a one of a kind data center that uses neither grey energy for construction, nor energy for cooling. On top of that all energy it actually uses comes from local, renewable energy sources.<br><br>Data Center Light evolved from simple data centers to a blueprint project that can enable country sides to regain economic power as well as attracting skilled workers.<br><br>Speaker of this meetup was Nico Schottelius, CEO of ungleich glarus AG, founder of the co-working space Digital Glarus and the brain behind Data Center Light."
